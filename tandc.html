    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 05/03/2025</p>
  
    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>
      Vortex is an AI-powered music recommendation chatbot that helps users discover songs based on mood, genre, or preference. It connects with third-party services like Spotify to deliver its core functionality.
    </p>

    <p>You are solely responsible for any activity carried out using your account or device.</p>
    <p>You agree not to misuse or attempt to exploit the AI system, its algorithms, or external music data sources.</p>
  
    <h2>3. Data Usage and Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Vortex may collect limited non-personal data (e.g., moods, genres, user interaction history) to improve recommendations.
      No personal information is stored or sold.
      By using Vortex, you agree to our data practices in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    </p>
  
    <h2>4. Third-Party Integration</h2>
    <p>
      Vortex uses Spotify APIs and may rely on other third-party services to fetch song data.
      Vortex does not claim ownership of any content retrieved from Spotify or other platforms.
      You must comply with the terms of any third-party service you access through Vortex.
    </p>
  
    <h2>5. AI Limitations</h2>
    <p>
      Vortex is a recommendation tool and not a licensed music provider.
      Song suggestions are generated by machine learning algorithms and may not always match user preferences accurately.
      Vortex may occasionally produce unexpected or irrelevant results, and you use the system with this understanding.
    </p>

      Unauthorized reproduction or redistribution of the platform design or code is strictly prohibited.
    </p>
  
    <h2>8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Vortex reserves the right to update these terms at any time without prior notice.
      Continued use of the service after changes constitutes your agreement to the revised terms.
    </p>
