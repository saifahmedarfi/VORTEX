    <h2>About Saif </h2>
    <p>
      My name is Saif Ahmed, and I am a student at North South University, currently studying Computer Science and Engineering. Along with my studies, I am passionate about music and am actively releasing my original tracks, which are available on Spotify, YouTube, and other music streaming platforms.

    <p>
      I have always loved creating projects that combine my technical skills and artistic passions. Music is my heart and soul, and I believe it connects people beyond boundaries. I also enjoy reading literature, diving into philosophy, and exploring new ideas.

    <p>
      This project, Vortex, is one of my favorite creations. It’s a manifestation of my love for music, technology, and a deeper connection with sound. I hope this platform helps others discover the joy of music tailored to their unique moods and feelings. Thank you for visiting Vortex!
